<h1>Manifesto</h1>

<h3>The proposals of trade union “IT Guild” for improving the economic situation in Latvia</h3>

<b>The main goal of trade union “IT Guild” is to achieve a competitive growth of Latvia, increase the level of welfare of our members, the particular family, company, industry. In order to achieve these goals economy should reach the level of productivity, which is the highest among the three Baltic States, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and is equal to the average of old 15 Member States of the European Union, as well as to enact amendments to the law, which makes the wage in Latvia from highest net wage among the Baltic countries the lowest in gross terms. </b><p>

<p>A particular focus of trade union “IT Guild” is placed on youth involvement in our activities. In Latvia there are 186,000 young people aged from 18 to 24 years, a large number of them are well-educated and able to provide a contribution to various economic sectors. We have elaborated our programme taking into consideration the recent year’ negative trend, whereas people of different ages groups, nationalities, social groups are emigrating from Latvia. Thus, the proposed measures will also prevent this trend from happening. The content of the youth events will be diverse and binding for anyone interested in enriching their business with the most up-to-date and efficient technology tools. After we would achieve substantial political support from the majority of members of parliament we will take three key steps in order to economic situation of our members: increase the wage level in the IT sector, related sectors, reduce the level of social dumping, vest the right to sign collective bargaining agreements only upon the registered trade unions. According to the findings of the economists the period of strong and stable economic growth shall be used to achieve even faster growth. The three blocks of proposed measures are being designed using the most advance methodology, through consulting with the industry experts and making use of the foreign partners’ successful experience.
<p>Firstly, the wage level in the IT sector shall be increased. While comparing the overall wage level in Latvia with the European union standards in 2008 average wages amounted to 33% of the old 15 Member States of the European Union average, in 2016 the annual average wage amounted to 34,7% of a percent of the old 15 Member States of the European Union. We shall contribute to the facilitation of this positive trend and achieve the average wage level of 70% of the old 15 Member States of the European Union transparent in nearest future. The level of remuneration in IT industry has grown significantly during recent years. This was mainly due to the fact that many local companies have outsourced their services. The related industries shall also achieve a faster wage growth. This issue of increased wage level shall be settled in conjunction with a range of other important issues. The focus shall be aimed on job retention, which is threatened by an economic factor - the lack of skilled workforce. Sufficient resources should be allocated to creation of research centres covering research and development in biotechnology, nanotechnology, and robotics. Those employees who experience the negative effects of robotic automation shall be provided training to obtain new skills. According to the statics data during the last 16 years more 100,000 people having higher education have left Latvia. As a result, currently there is a need for 10,000 university graduates. According to the findings of The Foreign Investors Council in Latvia requires 16,000 employees in various economic areas. Additional funds shall be allocated to the financing of industries where the majority of the trade union “IT guild” are employed. The administration of these resources shall be effective and efficient. The Government of Latvia shall implement the commitment to raise the salaries of secondary school teachers. The bigger is the availability of skilled mathematics teachers the better graduates are being prepared for the university level studies. The financing of these objectives can be found through reducing the share of the shadow economy, legalization the "envelope" salaries through the general agreement. The tax burden in Latvia for employees is the largest among the three Baltic States. While receiving the largest net wage among the three Baltic States Latvia has the lowest level of net pay. Thus, the competitiveness of labour wages shall be increased. This wage increase shall be done in a proportional manner. For example, the remuneration of a chairman of the executive board of a public limited liability company, the remuneration of members of the executive board, remuneration of a counselor, remuneration of the director of a department should be increased in view of the already existing high salary.
<p>Secondly, trade union “IT Guild” strongly opposes social dumping. This phenomenon is observed in countries where the market economy was relatively recently introduced. Industry experts indicate that the highly qualified workforce leaves the country and is being replaced with low skilled workers with a low wage level. Latvia can become a location, “springboard” where large transnational companies select the necessary personnel. We propose the following solution: remuneration level for highly qualified personnel must be at least 1,5 times greater than the average wage in a given time period. The remuneration level of unskilled personnel shall be gradually increased. Employer may hire such kind of employee only in case he or she could not find one on site. In a number of sectors in Latvia, for example, the state railway, productivity is the fourth highest in the European Union, but the level of this remuneration greatly lags behind the other Member States. The proportion of those employees with low wages shall be decreased. All amendments enacted to the legislation to couple with this situation shall be preserved.
<p>Thirdly, strong trade unions have developed in Latvia for over the past years. The Latvian Free Trade Union strongly supports employees, which is a great achievement. The legislation should provide that the collective agreement can only be concluded by registered trade unions and not by employees themselves. Besides, this trade union does not necessarily have to enter the Latvian Free Trade Union, it can create a larger trade union where the budget is used in accordance with its objectives. Dispute resolution between employers and employers should be encouraged within a reasonable time limit. Accordingly, legislative changes should be made which would allow the termination of the worker's employment relationship without the agreement of the trade union concerned, if he joined the trade union less than three months before the matter was raised.
In conclusion, by significantly increasing the level of pay, reducing labour market disproportions, strengthening trade unions can lead to the development of a specific business sector. Only by improving the working environment, the attitudes of the employer and by making the necessary changes to labour law will we achieve an economic breakthrough. Trade union "IT Guild" believes that only thanks to sustainable solutions will we achieve economic growth.
